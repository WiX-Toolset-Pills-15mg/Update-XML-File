## Update XML File

## Description

Sometimes, when deploying our application, we need to also update the contents of an xml file. It may be a config file or any other xml file.

One way to update the xml file is by creating a custom action and update it from C#.

This tutorial demonstrates how to update the xml file using an WiX Toolset extension from `WixUtilExtension.dll` library.

A step-by-step tutorial can be found in the `doc/article/README.md` document, [here](doc/article/README.md).
