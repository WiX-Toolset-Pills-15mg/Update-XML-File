## Description

Sometimes, when deploying our application, we need to also update the contents of an xml file. It may be a config file or any other xml file.

One way to update the xml file is by creating a custom action and update it from C#.

This tutorial demonstrates how to update the xml file using an WiX Toolset extension from `UtilExtension.dll` library.
